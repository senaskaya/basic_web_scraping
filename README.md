## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

1. **Final_Assignment_Library.ipynb**  
   This notebook defines a reusable Python library that includes several utility functions, primarily for data handling and parsing. Functions are written to be modular and used in other notebooks.

2. **Final_Assignment_Webscraping.ipynb**  
   Demonstrates how to scrape data from web pages using Pythonâ€™s `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and other libraries. It processes HTML content and extracts structured data (such as job postings, prices, etc.).

3. **Final_Assignment.ipynb**  
   The main notebook that brings together the custom library and web scraping logic. It represents a real-world scenario of using Python to extract and process data programmatically.
